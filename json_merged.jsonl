Porter Lee Corporation designs data migration plans to meet the following objectives.\n\nObjective 1 - Porter Lee Corporation will move all case related data into the LIMS database. This is accomplished by converting data into existing LIMS fields; Data which does not match an existing data element can be placed into comments. In addition, all tables from the source database are placed into LIMS supplemental tables.  This insures that the legacy data is always available in its original form.\n\nObjective 2 - Porter Lee Corporation will refine the conversion to insure the customer is satisfied with the presentation of the converted data within the LIMS. Many times this requires the conversion plan to be adjusted and the program to be re-run. \n\nObjective 3 - Porter Lee Corporation will insure the customer is satisfied with the presentation of the converted data within the LIMS. Many times this requires the conversion plan to be adjusted and the program to be re-run before acceptance.\n\nObjective 4 \u2013 Porter Lee Corporation will complete the conversion before training takes place. This allows the plan to include procedures for working with converted cases that were open at the time of the conversion, as well as cases that were created in the LIMS from the beginning.\n\nConversion Approach\n\nPorter Lee Corporation (PLC) takes the follow the following steps while converting laboratory case information into the Crime Fighter BEAST LIMS.\n\n1.\tThe Lab will provide the database(s) to PLC on CDROM. It is important that all the data be submitted to PLC, not just a sampling. This allows full testing to occur so that any exceptions are identified. The Lab should include any descriptive information available for the data. This includes a data dictionary, application screen shots or documentation if possible.\n\n2.\tThe data will be evaluated by PLC and an outline of the conversion process will be provided to the Lab.  The Lab will work together to refine this document.  This will require the programmer and the Lab\u2019s representative to discuss the data and the relationship between tables.\n\n3.\tAfter the first pass of conversion has taken place the Lab will be able to review the converted data in there own database. PLC will assist the Lab in comparing the data in the LIMS to the data in the existing computer system. If it is determined that there is a need to change the conversion Porter Lee Corporation will make the required changes and re-run the conversion. During this time period, Porter Lee Corporation cleanup work is normally done on certain table such as department names and item types.\n\n4.\tOnce all changes are done and the converted data is acceptable to the customer, the final conversion is scheduled a day before the Lab goes live with the BEAST LIMS.  The Lab should provide the final data on or before the same day the final conversion will take place. The final data should be in the same format as the original data.\n\n5.\tWhen the final converted data is in place and the Lab is live with the LIMS, the Lab may still request changes with the converted data.  All data from the provided database will be converted into the LIMS database unless otherwise noted.\n\n6.\tPorter Lee Corporation and the Lab will work together to create guidelines for LIMS users to continue work on cases that were in-progress when converted."}]}

Parties. This Porter Lee Corporation Software Support and Maintenance Agreement is between Porter Lee Corporation (\"PLC\") and __________ (\"Customer\").  This Support and Maintenance Agreement is subject to the terms of the Professional Services Agreement and the Contract Documents, as defined in the Professional Services Agreement, entered into contemporaneously with this Support and Maintenance Agreement and to which this Support and Maintenance Agreement is attached.\n\n2.  Effective Date. The effective date of this Porter Lee Corporation Software Support and Maintenance Agreement (\"Agreement\") is the effective date of the Professional Services Agreement.\n\n3.  Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence upon Final Acceptance as defined in ____. of the Professional Services Agreement (\u201cCommencement Date\u201d) and shall be in effect and continue for a period of one (1) year unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 4 of this agreement and subject to Customer's proper performance of its obligations hereunder. This agreement shall automatically renew for a period of one (1) year, and will continue to automatically renew each year thereafter, until and unless either party provides written notice of intent to terminate renewal, no less than sixty (60) days prior to the Renewal Date. The Renewal Date shall be one (1) year, and each consecutive year thereafter, following the anniversary of the Commencement Date.\n\n4.  Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party is in default of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including but not limited to non-payment of fees and material breach, and fails to correct such default within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from the other party.\n\n5.  Scope. Upon payment of the required Software Maintenance and Support Fee by Customer, PLC hereby agrees to provide software maintenance and support for the Crime Fighter Beast (Software) to Customer for the agreed upon term. PLC shall provide such software support and maintenance as may be necessary to maintain the Software in good operating condition and to meet the warranties set forth in the Contract Documents.  \n\n6.  Maintenance. PLC will provide all updates, enhancements to existing features, bug fixes, patches, upgrades, new releases, new versions, and modifications for the Software when it reaches production code for other customers at a rate of one free upgrade on an annual basis.  PLC will provide the corresponding up-to-date documentation with all such updates, patches, upgrades, new enhancements, bug fixes, new releases, new versions, and modifications. PLC will provide Customer with detailed documentation of all new features, updates, patches, upgrades, enhancements, bug fixes, new releases, new versions, and modifications as and when they reach production code for other customers. Customer has the option to incorporate these new features into existing systems. If additional customization hours are required by PLC to add these features, Customer must explicitly approve in writing the additional costs due PLC before implementation. PLC will not introduce enhancements to existing systems which require Customer to add such features. However, PLC reserves the right to incorporate new features to the base Software, provided it is implemented in such a manner as to be consistent with the previous sentence. Customer reserves the right to not upgrade to a new release of the Software. PLC will provide to Customer continued maintenance on previous Software versions should such an upgrade be released. All releases of the Software will be certified in Windows 7, and 10. All updates, patches, upgrades, enhancements, bug fixes, new releases, new versions, and modifications shall be compatible with the then most recent versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer.  No later than six (6) months following the release of a new version of the operating system, PLC will notify Customer of PLC's intention to convert the Software to the new release. Conversion will not require Customer to update to the new operating system. All customizations described in the Contract Documents (and any customizations subsequently acquired by Customer from PLC) shall be incorporated within the new releases and versions provided to Customer and Customer shall not be required to retrofit any of the customizations with the new releases or versions.\n\n7. Support. PLC establishes the following Technical Support guidelines:\n\na. PLC Obligations. All support requests (toll free phone or email) will be given a ticket number and assigned to a PLC Support Staff Individual. When contacting PLC, Customer shall classify the priority level of the problem based on the criteria set forth below.  PLC shall not re-classify the problem without the County\u2019s prior approval.  PLC shall respond to any problems reported by Customer according to the following priority levels:\n\n\n\n\tPriority Level 1:\n\n(a) Definition:  The problem causes an immediate major impact on Customer\u2019s business.  The Software or a significant component thereof is inoperable or substantially deviates from the specifications. No availability of an acceptable workaround or alternative solution.  \n\n(b)  Response:  PLC shall (1) respond to Customer within one hour of receipt of Customer\u2019s report during standard support hours; and (2) provide an initial status report to Customer and regularly communicate thereafter.\n\n\t\t(c)  Resolution:  Within one business day or an agreed upon due date.\n\n\n\n\tPriority Level 2:\n\n(a) Definition:  The problem impacts daily processing or day-to-day functions of Customer.  An acceptable workaround or alternative solution is available.  \n\n(b)  Response:  PLC shall (1) respond to Customer within four (4) hours of receipt of Customer\u2019s report during standard support hours; and (2) provide an initial status report to Customer and regularly communicate thereafter.\n\n(c)  Resolution:  Within five business days or an agreed upon due date.  \n\n\n\n\tPriority Level 3: \n\n(a)  Definition:  The problem requires correction but does not affect daily processing.  An acceptable workaround or alternative solution may be available. \n\n(b) Response:  PLC shall (1) respond to Customer within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of Customer\u2019s report during standard support hours; and (2) provide an initial status report to Customer and regularly communicate thereafter.\n\n(c)  Resolution:  Within ten business days or an agreed upon due date.\n\n\n\n \tAt all priority levels, if a workaround is available or reasonably feasible, PLC shall provide a workaround to Customer within two (2) hours of discovery of the workaround. Once an available workaround or alternative solution is provided, the Parties shall mutually agree upon a reclassification of the Priority Level.  \n\n\t\n\n\tA \u201cRoot Cause\u201d analysis shall be conducted to determine the nature of the reported issue.  If it is determined that the source of the system failure is due to Company software failure, the support services will be at no additional charge to Customer.  If the root cause is determined to arise from Customer negligence, misuse, third-party software or hardware failures, and/or new requirements, Customer may be invoiced for the additional support services provided by Company in efforts to resolve the reported issue.  Following Root Cause analysis, the Parties shall mutually agree upon a reclassification of the Priority Level.  \n\n\n\n Standard Support Hours are Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. (CST) to 5:30 p.m. (CST), excluding federally observed holidays.  The Company will maintain an emergency support number for exceptional situations, to be used during Non-Standard Support Hours.  It is provided to the Customer\u2019s designee. The number is answered by the Company\u2019s Director of Customer Support, or his/her designee.  Because this contact is provided only for the most extreme of circumstances, Customer will ensure Priority Level 1 criteria are met prior to initiating contact, and the Company will treat the situation as Priority Level 1 upon the start of the next period of Standard Support Hours.\n\nb. Customer Obligations. Only Customer's trained technical staff is granted permission to contact PLC's Support Center for assistance without the express written consent of PLC. Customer agrees to supply PLC with the means to remote access to the Customer's technical architecture for trouble shooting, problem resolution, and general support.

The Professional Services Agreement shall govern the provision of notices hereunder.\n\n11.  Successors. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective representatives, successors and assigns except as otherwise provided herein.\n\n12.  Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in force as if such provision were not a part hereof.\n\n13.  Governing Law/Forum. This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted by the laws of the State of Illinois. Cook County, Illinois shall be the appropriate venue and jurisdiction for the resolution of any disputes hereunder to the exclusion of all other venues, forums, and jurisdictions. \n\n14.  Non-Assignment. This Agreement and the rights assigned within it may not be reassigned, sublicensed, or otherwise transferred by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.\n\n15.  Entire Agreement. The Contract Documents, as defined in the Professional Services Agreement to which this Agreement is attached to and incorporated in sets forth the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merges and supersedes all prior agreements, discussions and understandings, express or implied.

The LIMS accepts the export file from CODIS and processes it on a daily basis. If samples are removed from CODIS, the user gets notified to take necessary action for expungement. The LIMS can be configured to perform auto expungement as well. The user is also notified of the statistics of the import process, for example, total number samples processed, samples missing in the LIMS, etc.  The LIMS creates the CMF file to upload to CODIS, and has the ability to mark the samples for CODIS upload upon processing the sample or upon technical review completion.   \n\n      Section 3.5 \u2013 Additional Information by Offeror:\n\nCrime Fighter BEAST LIMS RFID Integration\n\nThe Crime Fighter BEAST LIMS offers RFID integration for evidence, files and asset tracking.  Currently this feature is being implemented as an enhancement to the established barcode tracking solution.  The RFID tracking option provides the following:\n\n\uf0b7         Portal tracking (e.g. evidence passing in and out of an evidence vault doorway is logged)\n\n\uf0b7         Exit Portal Alarm (e.g. in addition to logging evidence \u201ctraffic\u201d, doorways can be designated to alarm uncertain conditions.  For example, an alarm will sound if an evidence item has a current custody of a lab location or status and an officer walks through the portal with that evidence to leave the building). \n\n\uf0b7         Notifications (e.g. at each facility, a group of people can be designated to receive a notification when there is an exit portal alarm.  This notification can be configured to provide the desired information about the location, package etc.)\n\n\uf0b7         Handheld locator (e.g. a portable handheld device can be used to locate a particular piece of evidence within an evidence room)\n\n\n\nPorter Lee uses Active RFID Link Technology.  The integration of the RFID solution is seamless to business processes in that it does not require additional RFID \u201cscan to associate\u201d steps.  Zebra RFID printers directly encode the chips within the labels with unique identifying information.  This important link of information is at the same time stored within the LIMS database.  The end user experience is that they simply print the label with its typical visual identifying information (e.g. unique case number, item number and barcode) within the LIMS.  Behind the scenes the LIMS will immediately have the ability to recognize the emission of the chip when it encounters a reader.  If relabeling ever needs to occur, a new RFID label can be associated to an existing item in LIMS by having an authorized user simply reprint a new label.  \n\n\n\nRFID Chip - Passive RFID chips are inlayed within barcode labels.  The term passive simply means that the reader, when in range, activates the barcode with an energy pulse and then the chip in the label sends a signal back.\n\n\n\nRFID Antennas/Readers - Leveraging the advancements in tag and reader sensitivity that no longer require facing left and right handed polarized antenna portal type configuration, The Crime Fighter BEAST LIMS uses the latest readers and cutting edge antennas with circular polarization from Alien Technology.  \n\n\n\nFuture BEAST LIMS RFID feature Roadmap\n\n\n\nFuture extensions of functionality may include, but are not limited to:\n\n\uf0b7         RFID tracking on racks and instrumentation through an integrated analysis process (e.g. DNA sample analysis)\n\n\uf0b7         Inventory Audits\n\n\uf0b7         Supply Re-ordering and Asset Maintenance\n\n\uf0b7         Expanded notifications on evidence and asset movement\n\n\uf0b7         Item Type specific customizations (e.g. Sexual Assault Kit Tracking and Result notifications)"}]}

CrimePad can even operate in an offline mode were connectivity is not available for extremely remote scenes.  Data can then be synced up once connectivity is restored. \n\n       Section 3.13 \u2013 Additional Information by Offeror:\n\nCrimePad is a mobile-first, active investigation management system designed for all members involved in an investigation, including crime scene professionals, detectives, supervisors, and command staff. \n\nCrimePad provides an array of tools, such as case and scene data forms, lead management, evidence logging, photo/video/ document storage, interviews, and reports. With these and a host of other features, CrimePad creates real time collaboration between all team members. As a result, information is shared quickly and efficiently, leading to high quality and effective inves- tigations. \n\nUsing cloud-based technology (private or securely hosted) coupled with tablets, smartphones, laptops, and desktops, CrimePad is available at any location at any time. This allows CSIs and investigators to stay in the field longer without having to return to an office for debriefing or for transcribing notes. \n\nAll physical evidence must be thoroughly documented and collected. The Evidence element allows you to completely record evidence numbers, collection information, evidence descriptions, processing information, packaging, and anticipated forensic analysis. This element also allows you to print evidence labels to a portable label printer so that you can label packaging with pertinent information rather than writing on the packaging by hand. This can save a tremendous amount of time. \n\nCrimePad allows you to attach any case, scene, or element file that supplements the entered data. Digital photographs, for example, are common les to upload and store within the secure CrimePad electronic case file. Audio, video, PDF, Word, and other file types can also be stored and attached to specific elements within the case. These can dramatically aid the investigation and provide a centralized repository for all case files. \n\nAs investigations progress dynamically and data is collected, it is important for supervisors and command staff to monitor the state of the investigation and allocate resources. To aid in this, CrimePad includes dashboards that provide a snapshot of the entire case in a succinct and intuitive way. It displays where resources and personnel have been applied and helps facilitate the assignment of tasks and leads as they emerge. \n\n\n\nCrimePad and the Crime Fighter BEAST LIMS work together through a tight interface, passing required information that make sense from a workflow perspective between the ISP Crime Scene Services Command and the Laboratory.\n\n\n\n Prepared by Porter Lee Corporation\t\tPage 26 of 41"}]}
