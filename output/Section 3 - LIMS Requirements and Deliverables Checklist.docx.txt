      Section 3.5 – Additional Information by Offeror:

Crime Fighter BEAST LIMS RFID Integration

The Crime Fighter BEAST LIMS offers RFID integration for evidence, files and asset tracking.  Currently this feature is being implemented as an enhancement to the established barcode tracking solution.  The RFID tracking option provides the following:

         Portal tracking (e.g. evidence passing in and out of an evidence vault doorway is logged)

         Exit Portal Alarm (e.g. in addition to logging evidence “traffic”, doorways can be designated to alarm uncertain conditions.  For example, an alarm will sound if an evidence item has a current custody of a lab location or status and an officer walks through the portal with that evidence to leave the building). 

         Notifications (e.g. at each facility, a group of people can be designated to receive a notification when there is an exit portal alarm.  This notification can be configured to provide the desired information about the location, package etc.)

         Handheld locator (e.g. a portable handheld device can be used to locate a particular piece of evidence within an evidence room)

Porter Lee uses Active RFID Link Technology.  The integration of the RFID solution is seamless to business processes in that it does not require additional RFID “scan to associate” steps.  Zebra RFID printers directly encode the chips within the labels with unique identifying information.  This important link of information is at the same time stored within the LIMS database.  The end user experience is that they simply print the label with its typical visual identifying information (e.g. unique case number, item number and barcode) within the LIMS.  Behind the scenes the LIMS will immediately have the ability to recognize the emission of the chip when it encounters a reader.  If relabeling ever needs to occur, a new RFID label can be associated to an existing item in LIMS by having an authorized user simply reprint a new label.  

RFID Chip - Passive RFID chips are inlayed within barcode labels.  The term passive simply means that the reader, when in range, activates the barcode with an energy pulse and then the chip in the label sends a signal back.

RFID Antennas/Readers - Leveraging the advancements in tag and reader sensitivity that no longer require facing left and right handed polarized antenna portal type configuration, The Crime Fighter BEAST LIMS uses the latest readers and cutting edge antennas with circular polarization from Alien Technology.  

Future BEAST LIMS RFID feature Roadmap

Future extensions of functionality may include, but are not limited to:

       Section 3.13 – Additional Information by Offeror:

CrimePad is a mobile-first, active investigation management system designed for all members involved in an investigation, including crime scene professionals, detectives, supervisors, and command staff. 

CrimePad provides an array of tools, such as case and scene data forms, lead management, evidence logging, photo/video/ document storage, interviews, and reports. With these and a host of other features, CrimePad creates real time collaboration between all team members. As a result, information is shared quickly and efficiently, leading to high quality and effective inves- tigations. 

Using cloud-based technology (private or securely hosted) coupled with tablets, smartphones, laptops, and desktops, CrimePad is available at any location at any time. This allows CSIs and investigators to stay in the field longer without having to return to an office for debriefing or for transcribing notes. 

All physical evidence must be thoroughly documented and collected. The Evidence element allows you to completely record evidence numbers, collection information, evidence descriptions, processing information, packaging, and anticipated forensic analysis. This element also allows you to print evidence labels to a portable label printer so that you can label packaging with pertinent information rather than writing on the packaging by hand. This can save a tremendous amount of time. 

CrimePad allows you to attach any case, scene, or element file that supplements the entered data. Digital photographs, for example, are common les to upload and store within the secure CrimePad electronic case file. Audio, video, PDF, Word, and other file types can also be stored and attached to specific elements within the case. These can dramatically aid the investigation and provide a centralized repository for all case files. 

As investigations progress dynamically and data is collected, it is important for supervisors and command staff to monitor the state of the investigation and allocate resources. To aid in this, CrimePad includes dashboards that provide a snapshot of the entire case in a succinct and intuitive way. It displays where resources and personnel have been applied and helps facilitate the assignment of tasks and leads as they emerge. 



CrimePad and the Crime Fighter BEAST LIMS work together through a tight interface, passing required information that make sense from a workflow perspective between the ISP Crime Scene Services Command and the Laboratory.
