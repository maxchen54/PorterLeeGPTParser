Q&A RESPONSE
Offerors are requested to respond to this list of questions to clarify details of the bids.

General Product Questions:
1. Describe how your product handles evidence analysis for multiple types of forensic
analysis disciplines.
Each forensic discipline may be configured to have their own worksheets, data entry
screens, report templates, review cycle steps, and final report formats. It is typical for
the lab to provide guidelines for formatting on a laboratory wide basis while leaving
space to accommodate the differences between disciplines.
2. What is your implementation structure for on premises, include an overview of
architecture.
A minimum setup would include a database server (SQL or Oracle), a web server (IIS)
, an application server (IIS) , and a prelog/dmz server(IIS). Each server can be made
redundant by adding additional nodes and a load balancer.
Please see the attached “Network Design Options.PDF” for more detailed information.
3. Describe a typical implementation plan and timeline for your product, including initial
and on-going training.

address of the client. This information can be searched, viewed, and printed by
authorized users.
12. Describe how your product handles task management and notifications.
Tasks can be assigned to examiners automatically, individually, or in batch by
supervisors. All tasks have a type, status code, assigner, assignee, and date fields to
track when the task was assigned and completed. Users can be notified on the
dashboard or via email when tasks are assigned or overdue.
13. Describe how your product accounts for automated data requests to/from external
customers and partners.
PLC prefers to interface with third parties using rest web service technology and has
experience doing so with many vendors and interfaces. Legacy interface technology
can also be supported including ftp file shipping, xml or SOAP services, and direct
database connections etc.
14. Describe how your product facilitates appropriate security for CODIS database
information.
Our databank product can be integrated within LIMS and be protected by user roles.

server if desired. In the separated model an API is available to allow for hit letters to be
generated referring to cases from the other database.
15. Describe how your product provides ad-hoc data extraction and what limitations there
are, if any.
The LIMS database is open to authorized BI analysts and LIMS Administrators. The
data can be extracted and analyzed using third party tools. Examples include SSRS,
Oracle reports, COGNOS, SAP Business Objects, MS Access, and MS Excel. Also,
the LIMS itself includes integrated ad hoc reporting using Stock management reports,
customizable management reports and crystal reports.

16. Describe how your product integrates with external applications and products.
The application uses MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Reader for many functions. Each
user should have a license for MS Office locally installed applications. The free version
of Adobe Acrobat is sufficient.
17. Describe how your product provides secure access to reports and data; e.g. portals.
The system provides two different portals for access to work product. PRELOG is a
web portal designed for submitting agencies to submit cases, access case status and
view and download completed reports. Prosecutors may also have access to PRELOG
for download completed report for departments they have jurisdiction over.
The Discovery Portal is a specialized portal for prosecutors to use. They are able to
create self service requests for discovery which are automatically filled by the
discovery services, zipped and downloaded by the requestors. The lab has the option
of being able to review the discovery packages before publishing if desired. The
discovery portal is typically used when a high volume of discovery requests might
otherwise overwhelm the laboratory staff.
Authentication for both portals can be application defined or be integrated with
enterprise identity providers.
Technical Questions:
1. Describe how your product utilizes externally licensed programs.
Users will require Microsoft 365 licenses to install local copies of Office products such
as WORD and Excel. Crystal Reports Designer must be purchased and licensed on
the web servers and for any user who would edit report definitions. Regular users do
not require a license for crystal reports. The customer is responsible for purchasing
and maintenance of these licenses.
2. Describe how your data is stored; Database type (e.g. SQL), tables, warehouse,
management, architecture, etc.
We use a combination of SQL Data Tables for relational data and network file storage
for images and attachments.
3. What are the proposed solution’s security controls and permission levels? How
granular can user permissions be configured?
The security roles are customizable for the lab. Roles can be defined, and specific
security permissions are then assigned to the roles. Finally, each user may be a
member of one or more roles.

4. Do you have CE Cyber Security verification?
Being an on premise application if the lab hires an outside contractor or performs their
own cyber security testing and certification PLC will correct or remediate any nonconformities related to the application.
5. Could you provide a SOC 2 type II report upon request?
Providing and securing cloud services is not a part of this proposal, but PLC is willing
to provide a copy of their own security plan for review. PLC also maintains yearly ISO
accreditation and can also provide that information.
6. FIPS 140-2 will end-of-life in 2026. Will the proposed solution be able to comply with
FIPS 140-3 by then https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/fips-140-3-transition-effort.
Yes
7. Where is your hardware and electronics manufactured?
PLC does not provide servers, electronics, or network hardware. PLC recommends
industry standard Zebra Technologies for barcode equipment and Dell servers but
since this in an on-premise system it is the lab’s choice.
8. Describe the disaster recovery and backup plan for the proposed solution.
For on-premise solutions, the customer will configure and maintain redundancy to
meet their desired level of availability. The customer will also perform backups and
store the media physically or in the cloud according to their in-house retention policies.
The customer will perform restoration tests on an annual basis. PLC will provide
necessary consultation and assistance with tests and actual recovery if required..

9. How frequently is data backed up and how frequently is the disaster recovery
capability tested?
PLC does not provide this service for on-premise systems. PLC will participate and
help plan the testing of the restore process with the in-house IT staff. The data can be
backed up every 15 minutes if desired.
10. Is security awareness training required for all employees and contractors who access
the system?
All of PLC’s support staff receive training via CJIS online – level 4. PLC also conducts
annual internal security training according to our security plan.
11. Are criminal background checks required for all employees and contractors who
access the system?
Yes. However, being an on-premise system the lab or state would perform conduct the
checks before issuing credentials to the contractor.
12. Is data encrypted in transit? What kind of encryption is used?
Yes, TLS 1.2
13. Does the web server support any legacy protocols?
Only if required. For example, Azure Open ID connect would be preferred over
